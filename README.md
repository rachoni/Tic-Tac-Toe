# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, structured with modular code organization. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. 

## Features:
- **Modular structure**: The game logic is divided into multiple files and directories for better maintainability.
- **Win and Draw Tracking**: Player wins are stored in a text file, and draws are recorded separately.
- **Console-based Gameplay**: The current version runs in the terminal.
- **Future Updates**:
  - Integration with `tkinter` for a graphical user interface.
  - Addition of a JavaScript-based frontend.
  - Enhancements to improve the game logic and user experience.

This repository is ideal for Python learners looking to understand modular programming and file handling. Future updates will introduce GUI elements and web-based interaction.
